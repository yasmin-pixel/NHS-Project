# ü©∫ NHS COVID-19 Data Analysis (2020‚Äì2023)

## Overview  
This repository contains a data analysis project exploring the impact of COVID-19 in the United Kingdom using NHS-related datasets between 2020 and 2023. The goal is to visualize the spread, trends, and impact of COVID-19 across different regions and timeframes, providing useful insights for public health awareness, policy, and service planning.

This project serves as a portfolio piece demonstrating skills in **data analysis**, **visualization**, and **insight generation** using **Python**. The complete analysis was performed within a Jupyter Notebook environment and is included in this repository.

## Methodology & Tools

The analysis was conducted using **Python** within a Jupyter Notebook environment.

### üîç Key Steps:
- **Data Loading & Cleaning**: Loaded multiple CSV datasets; standardized date formats, column names, and missing values.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Explored overall COVID-19 case distribution by region and time.
- **Visualization**: Generated informative visualizations using **Plotly**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**.
- **Theming**: All visuals were styled to align with **NHS colours** for clarity and professional presentation.

### üõ†Ô∏è Main Libraries:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `plotly`

## Key Findings & Insights

The analysis of NHS COVID-19 data revealed:

- **Distinct Waves**: Several distinguishable waves of COVID-19 spread occurred with peaks in early 2020, Winter 2021, and mid-2022.
- **Regional Disparities**: Certain regions consistently showed higher case loads and hospital admissions, indicating disparities in exposure or healthcare access.
- **Post-lockdown Impact**: Gradual reopening policies correlated with a resurgence in cases, though with fewer hospitalisations.

---

## Observations & Potential Recommendations

- **Regional Support**: Increase support and healthcare capacity in consistently high-burden areas.
- **Data-Driven Communication**: Use localised data to guide public messaging and safety regulations.
- **Pandemic Preparedness**: Build systems for faster real-time regional monitoring and resource allocation.
- **Vaccination Focus**: Continue promoting vaccines and boosters in demographics with lower uptake.


---

## Limitations & Future Work

### ‚õî Limitations:
- **Static Historical Data**: Analysis ends in 2023. Ongoing data post-2023 could provide better understanding of long-term impacts.
- **No Comorbidity Analysis**: Lacks integration with patient-specific clinical records, which would allow deeper health outcome analysis.
- **Economic & Social Dimensions**: No data on socioeconomic impact, public compliance, or mental health trends included in this version.
